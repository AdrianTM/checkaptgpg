Description: check and add missing GPG keys needed by apt
 Check Apt GPG will scan the already downloaded Release files cached by apt
 (and siblings) and will check that any needed GPG keys are available. It will
 print a GPG status for each repository found. If one or more GPG keys are
 found to be missing, it will request root password and run again as root,
 attempting to download the missing GPG key(s) from several large keyservers.
